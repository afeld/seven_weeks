# Seven Weeks

Code and exercises from the [Seven Languages in Seven Months Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/7-Languages-in-7-Months-NYC/), which is following [the book of similar name](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks").

Thanks to [@julian](https://github.com/Julian/SevenWeeks) for the idea of putting code here.
